This builds on v3.5 by adding numerical input for floor number instead of primary location.
According to the firefighters in Toronto fire station No. 315, it is useful to have a numerical
input for the location as it would be inconvenient to use a drop-down menu for large numbers of
floors when tracking location.

<li>Contrast ratio testing.</li>
<li>16px+ fonts</li>
<li>Multiple routed pages for decreased cognitive load</li>
<li>Better iPad scalability (still optimizing, currently has best performance on windows touch laptops)</li>
<li>Emptying drop downs when teams sign out of the fire.</li>
<li>Alphabetical ordering for pre-existing locations and assignments</li>
