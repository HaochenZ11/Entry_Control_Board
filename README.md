# Entry_Control_Board

### What this Is
We are making a digitized version of the entry control board used by firefighters in the GTA. The board keeps track of where each firefighting team is within a building and what their current task is.

###`Angular`
I learned Angular for this project, so the `Angular` folder has my preliminary angular demos.

###`Prototype_01`
This is a bare-bones version of our product. The only function is for it to be testable in the simplest sense. Its functionality includes:
1. Table-based representation for the firefighting teams (hard-coded teams)
2. Dropdown for each team for where they are, what their assignment is (hard-coded assignments)
3. Dropdown for location (hard-coded locations)

Notable things not included:
* Timing functionality
* Adding/subtracting firefighter teams
* Adding/subtracting assignments
* Adding/subtracting locations
